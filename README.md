# Web-design
Design a homepage for yourself (including at least 3 linked pages)
Include your personal photo, your personal information, your contact information, educational information and work history (if any) or your interests. You can design this personal page in the simplest way only with HTML. However, it is recommended to use the cascading style tool (css) to design your pages more elegantly
